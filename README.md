Problem definition: Scheduling jobs on a single machine that needs occasional calibration. Jobs can be short or long depending on their execution times, so we are given n1 and n2 number of jobs of each length. To execute jobs, machine needs to be in a calibrated state. Upon calibration, machine stays calibrated for a certain amount of time from a set of possible calibration lengths T={t1, t2, ... tk}. Upon calibrating machine, we can probe current interval to determine its exact calibration length. If probing cost and calibration cost are given and they take no time, determine the schedule that minimizes total execution cost.
